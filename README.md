<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As a full-stack web developer, I have developed a timed coding quiz application that features multiple-choice questions. This application runs in the browser, and is powered by dynamic HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. The user interface is clean, polished and responsive. This application was designed to help users become familiar with coding assessments and to apply the skills learned in the module.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

 The quiz includes a countdown timer and rewards users for correct answers while penalizing them for wrong answers. The quiz also includes a high score page that logs the user's score and allows them to input their initials. The quiz also includes a clear high score button that allows the user to clear the high score page. The quiz also includes a go back button that allows the user to return to the starting page. The application also includes a function to store quiz results in local storage, as well as a function to retrieve and display quiz results in highscore.html.
